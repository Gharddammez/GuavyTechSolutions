										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has recently launched a new local search box in mobile SERP called <strong>Nearby Events and Deals</strong>. The new feature allows shows users different Google Map Business deals and events that are happening in the vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It displays promotions, deals, and events from various businesses&#8217; Google Business Profile posts, popping up in your local searches.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Google Nearby Events &amp; Deals Feature? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature is great for offering local businesses a chance to boost conversions. If you want to appear on Google Nearby Events &amp; Deals and your business happens to have a Google Business Profile, posting regularly and optimizing your GMB posts will get you a chance to appear in this section. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you search for your desired query, such as “best breakfast in Nairobi” or “best brunch in Toronto,” the feature will filter the best results and show any nearby events or happening deals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These results typically appear lower on the </span><b>mobile SERP</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, positioned beneath the local pack, organic results, &#8216;People also ask,&#8217; and &#8216;People also search for.&#8217; </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-13321 aligncenter" src="wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1-178x300.jpeg" alt="google nearby events &amp; deals" width="425" height="716" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1-178x300.jpeg 178w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1-14x24.jpeg 14w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1-21x36.jpeg 21w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1-28x48.jpeg 28w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1.jpeg 582w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature appears in four tiles with the company title, a promotional photo, and a review rating. If you see something you like, Google takes you to a full-screen view of the offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, you will find the business name, its location on Google Maps, and a visually appealing image of the promotion. You will also find a small descriptive text that will discuss its features. </span></p>
<h2><b>How Does Google Nearby Event Feature Work? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google collects information from a list of websites that have a reputation for collecting news on events. Some of these sites are Ticketmaster, Eventbrite, SeatGeek, Bookmyshow.com, Allevents.in, LiveNation, Meetup, and many others. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-13323 aligncenter" src="wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-183x300.jpeg" alt="google nearby events &amp; deals" width="357" height="585" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-183x300.jpeg 183w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-15x24.jpeg 15w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-22x36.jpeg 22w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-29x48.jpeg 29w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM.jpeg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per Google, the list of these nearby event websites often changes depending on relevance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the event is coming up or there’s a lucrative deal on any product offerings or service offerings, Google will automatically pull up GMB profiles of the business and showcase the event or deal on relevant keyword searches for the user. </span></p>
<h2><b>Why Is This Feature Important for Local Businesses? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many local businesses always run enticing deals or events that they want to promote to increase business. When these deals and events start showing up on local searches, it becomes easier for them to reach out to their previous existing customers and new ones alike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a local business owner planning to sell your product/service online, and you have come up with a deal or hosting an event, <strong>Google Nearby Events &amp; Deals</strong> can provide you with a chance to make it visible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a local business, it’s more than mandatory to keep posting for GMB profiles regularly, especially if you have year-end or holiday season deals planned and ready for dispatch. </span></p>
<p><b>Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature is exclusive to local searches on mobile devices and has not been observed on Google Maps.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Can Businesses Optimize Their Listings for Nearby Events &amp; Deals? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure your events appear on Google:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check if your event publisher integrates with Google search. If so, continue posting events on their platform.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use a CMS like WordPress without HTML access, find a plugin to add structured data or use Google&#8217;s Data Highlighter.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If experienced with HTML editing, directly integrate with Google using structured data on your event pages.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>How To Show Up In Nearby Events &amp; Deals?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For optimal performance of your event structured data:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure the inclusion of required and recommended properties as per our developer guidelines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain high-quality event details; utilize the description field to elaborate on the event rather than duplicate the title, date, and location.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize the Rich Result Test to validate and preview your structured data.</span></li>
</ol>

</ul>
<h3><b>Drawbacks of Google Nearby Events &amp; Deals </b></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliance on Third-Party Websites</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Businesses can have limited control over the event listings, as most of them are present on external event platforms. </span></li>
<li><strong>Potential Inaccuracy </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; There’s always a risk of displaying outdated or incorrect event details, especially when the information is on third-party websites. </span></li>
<li><strong>Limited Exposure</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Not all businesses may be eligible to appear or get featured in Nearby Event listings, limiting their exposure to local establishments. </span></li>
<li><strong>Competition for Attention</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; When multiple businesses start vying for user attention in nearby event listings, it can make it challenging for your business to stand out. </span></li>
<li><strong>Dependency on Google Algorithms</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> &#8211;</strong> Changes in Google’s algorithm can lead to fluctuations in business exposure. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to highlight that the Nearby Events &amp; Deals feature, as per our testing, only shows up for food and restaurant businesses and is currently showing up for US based local searches.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s digital age, appearing on the first page of Google search results is a game-changer for any business. But what about when potential customers are looking for services or products in their immediate vicinity? That&#8217;s where Google Maps comes into play. Ranking higher on Google Maps can boost local visibility and drive foot traffic to your brick-and-mortar establishment. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore the best strategies to ensure your business is top on Google Maps.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastering Google Maps: 10 Proven Tactics to Dominate Local Search Rankings</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following are the ten best strategies to ensure your business takes the top spot on Google Maps;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claim and Optimize Your Google My Business Listing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step in climbing the Google Maps rankings is claiming your Google My Business (GMB) listing. Ensure your listing has accurate business information such as address, phone number, business hours, and high-quality images. Consistent and up-to-date information builds credibility and trust with customers and Google&#8217;s algorithms.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage Positive Reviews</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive reviews are like gold on Google Maps. Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews on your GMB listing. Respond to reviews, both positive and negative, promptly and professionally. The more positive feedback you receive, the better your chances of ranking higher.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create Engaging Content</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging content isn&#8217;t just for websites and social media. Utilize the Posts feature on your GMB listing to share updates, promotions, and announcements. Google rewards businesses that actively engage with their audience by boosting their Maps rankings.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include Relevant Keywords</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like traditional search engine optimization (SEO), keywords are vital in Google Maps rankings. Incorporate relevant keywords into your business description and posts, but avoid keyword stuffing. Make sure the content reads naturally.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accurate NAP Information</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NAP stands for Name, Address, and Phone Number. Consistency is critical—ensure this information is consistent across your website, GMB listing, and other online directories. Google values accuracy and will reward you for it.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add Photos and Videos</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual content captures attention and builds trust. Include high-quality photos and videos of your business, products, and services. This improves user experience and signals to Google that your business is active and relevant.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local Citations and Backlinks</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building local citations and backlinks from reputable local sources can boost your Google Maps rankings. Get your business listed in relevant local directories and collaborate with other companies for mutually beneficial linking.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location-specific Landing Pages</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create location-specific landing pages on your website if you have multiple locations or serve different areas. Each page should have localized content, unique NAP information, and keywords tailored to that location.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistent Business Information</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from your GMB listing, ensure your business information is consistent across all online platforms, including social media profiles, local directories, and your website. This consistency reinforces your credibility and authority in the eyes of both customers and Google.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage with Google Q&amp;A</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Q&amp;A is an often-overlooked feature that can help you engage directly with potential customers. Encourage customers to ask questions about your business and respond to these inquiries promptly. This demonstrates your commitment to customer service and can positively impact your Maps rankings.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s digital age, establishing a solid online presence is significant for any business to thrive. Among the various online platforms available, Google My Business (GMB) stands out as a powerful tool to enhance your online visibility and attract potential customers. This blog will explore the benefits of leveraging Google My Business and how it can maximize your online presence while improving your search engine rankings.</p>
<h2>What is Google My Business?</h2>
<p>Google My Business is an accessible and user-friendly platform provided by Google, designed to help businesses manage their online presence across Google&#8217;s search engine and maps. By creating and verifying a GMB listing, businesses can appear in local search results, making it easier for potential customers to find essential information about your company.</p>
<h3>Boost Local Search Visibility</h3>
<p>GMB is a potent tool for local search engine optimization (SEO). When someone searches for products or services linked to your business in your area, having an optimized Google My Business listing increases the chances of your business showing up in the &#8220;Local Pack&#8221; or the &#8220;Google 3-Pack&#8221; (the top three business listings displayed in local search results). This high visibility can lead to increased website traffic, foot traffic to your physical location, and, ultimately, more conversions.</p>
<p>To optimize your GMB listing for local search, ensure that you provide accurate business information such as your name, address, phone number (NAP), business hours, and category.</p>
<h3>Showcasing Your Business Information</h3>
<p>Google My Business offers a comprehensive platform to showcase essential information about your business. Utilize the &#8220;Posts&#8221; feature to highlight promotions, events, new products, or any updates related to your business. Regularly posting engaging content can keep your audience informed and interested, leading to increased customer engagement.</p>
<p>Use the &#8220;Q&amp;A&#8221; feature to answer frequently asked questions about your business. You can create trust with prospective customers and demonstrate excellent customer service by providing prompt and helpful responses.</p>
<h3>Customer Reviews and Ratings</h3>
<p>Customer reviews and ratings play an essential role in influencing consumer decisions. Positive reviews build trust and credibility and improve your prospect of ranking higher in search results. Motivate satisfied customers to leave reviews on your GMB listing and respond to both positive and negative reviews professionally and courteously.</p>
<h3>Google My Business Messaging</h3>
<p>With the messaging feature in GMB, businesses can directly communicate with potential customers. This real-time communication lets you address inquiries, offer support, and schedule appointments or reservations.</p>
<h3>Insights and Analytics</h3>
<p>Google My Business provides valuable input on how customers find and interact with your listing. You can track metrics such as the number of views, clicks, calls, and direction requests your listing receives. These insights enable you to analyze your GMB performance, make data-driven decisions, and identify areas of improvement to optimize your online presence further.</p>

<h3><b>Local Pack, Finder, Organic Search Results &amp; Google Maps</b></h3>
<p>Local Pack is the specific area that appears on top of the search engine result page but right below the Google Search bar. It contains the listings with pinpoint locations on the map of your desired local business marking the exact location where your business is present.</p>
<p>Local Finder is a location-based feature offered by Google Search which helps you identify your business, whether it appears in the Local Pack of Google or not. Beneath the Local Finder is the Localized Organic Result, which usually appears like every other website in Google Search.</p>
