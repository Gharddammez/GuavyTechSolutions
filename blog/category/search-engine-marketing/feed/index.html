<p>With more than <b>5.6 billion</b> searches per day of the world performing online searches on the Internet, almost <strong>46 percent</strong> of the individuals perform them in their local areas for local businesses.</p>
<h3><b>What is Local SEO?</b></h3>
<p>Local SEO is a popular practice where you optimize your content on relevant area-based search terms so your content can start appearing on the top searches in that particular region.</p>
<p>It helps increase your online visibility, helps others easily find your stuff online within your vicinity, and gives you more authenticity in the online world.</p>
<p>In order to carry out local SEO, you may have to perform multiple practices such as,</p>
<ul>
<li>Claim and optimize your Google Business profile.</li>
<li>Work on your business reputation</li>
<li>Perform a thorough website optimization</li>
<li>Perform effective citation building</li>
<li>Optimizing your site content according to changing Google algorithm</li>
<li>Avoid spam at all cost</li>
<li>And work on local link building for your website</li>
</ul>
<p>If you implement these practices effectively, you will eventually see your website start effectively appearing in the Local Pack, the Local Finder, and Local Organized Results, and also on top in Google Maps.</p>
<h3><b>Local Pack, Finder, Organic Search Results &amp; Google Maps</b></h3>
<p>Local Pack is the specific area that appears on top of the search engine result page but right below the Google Search bar. It contains the listings with pinpoint locations on the map of your desired local business marking the exact location where your business is present.</p>
<p>Local Finder is a location-based feature offered by Google Search which helps you identify your business, whether it appears in the Local Pack of Google or not. Beneath the Local Finder is the Localized Organic Result, which usually appears like every other website in Google Search.</p>
