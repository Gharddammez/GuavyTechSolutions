										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has recently launched a new local search box in mobile SERP called <strong>Nearby Events and Deals</strong>. The new feature allows shows users different Google Map Business deals and events that are happening in the vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It displays promotions, deals, and events from various businesses&#8217; Google Business Profile posts, popping up in your local searches.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Google Nearby Events &amp; Deals Feature? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature is great for offering local businesses a chance to boost conversions. If you want to appear on Google Nearby Events &amp; Deals and your business happens to have a Google Business Profile, posting regularly and optimizing your GMB posts will get you a chance to appear in this section. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you search for your desired query, such as “best breakfast in Nairobi” or “best brunch in Toronto,” the feature will filter the best results and show any nearby events or happening deals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These results typically appear lower on the </span><b>mobile SERP</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, positioned beneath the local pack, organic results, &#8216;People also ask,&#8217; and &#8216;People also search for.&#8217; </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-13321 aligncenter" src="wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1-178x300.jpeg" alt="google nearby events &amp; deals" width="425" height="716" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1-178x300.jpeg 178w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1-14x24.jpeg 14w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1-21x36.jpeg 21w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1-28x48.jpeg 28w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-1.jpeg 582w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature appears in four tiles with the company title, a promotional photo, and a review rating. If you see something you like, Google takes you to a full-screen view of the offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, you will find the business name, its location on Google Maps, and a visually appealing image of the promotion. You will also find a small descriptive text that will discuss its features. </span></p>
<h2><b>How Does Google Nearby Event Feature Work? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google collects information from a list of websites that have a reputation for collecting news on events. Some of these sites are Ticketmaster, Eventbrite, SeatGeek, Bookmyshow.com, Allevents.in, LiveNation, Meetup, and many others. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-13323 aligncenter" src="wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-183x300.jpeg" alt="google nearby events &amp; deals" width="357" height="585" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-183x300.jpeg 183w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-15x24.jpeg 15w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-22x36.jpeg 22w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM-29x48.jpeg 29w, wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-13-at-2.24.35-PM.jpeg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per Google, the list of these nearby event websites often changes depending on relevance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the event is coming up or there’s a lucrative deal on any product offerings or service offerings, Google will automatically pull up GMB profiles of the business and showcase the event or deal on relevant keyword searches for the user. </span></p>
<h2><b>Why Is This Feature Important for Local Businesses? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many local businesses always run enticing deals or events that they want to promote to increase business. When these deals and events start showing up on local searches, it becomes easier for them to reach out to their previous existing customers and new ones alike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a local business owner planning to sell your product/service online, and you have come up with a deal or hosting an event, <strong>Google Nearby Events &amp; Deals</strong> can provide you with a chance to make it visible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a local business, it’s more than mandatory to keep posting for GMB profiles regularly, especially if you have year-end or holiday season deals planned and ready for dispatch. </span></p>
<p><b>Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature is exclusive to local searches on mobile devices and has not been observed on Google Maps.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Can Businesses Optimize Their Listings for Nearby Events &amp; Deals? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure your events appear on Google:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check if your event publisher integrates with Google search. If so, continue posting events on their platform.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use a CMS like WordPress without HTML access, find a plugin to add structured data or use Google&#8217;s Data Highlighter.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If experienced with HTML editing, directly integrate with Google using structured data on your event pages.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>How To Show Up In Nearby Events &amp; Deals?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For optimal performance of your event structured data:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure the inclusion of required and recommended properties as per our developer guidelines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain high-quality event details; utilize the description field to elaborate on the event rather than duplicate the title, date, and location.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize the Rich Result Test to validate and preview your structured data.</span></li>
</ol>

<h3><b>Drawbacks of Google Nearby Events &amp; Deals </b></h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><b>Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to highlight that the Nearby Events &amp; Deals feature, as per our testing, only shows up for food and restaurant businesses and is currently showing up for US based local searches.</span></p>

<h2><b>Benefits of Local SEO for Small Businesses</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Whatever the business you are running, local SEO will do wonders by attracting clients and driving traffic towards your business. Below are the key benefits of local </span><span style="font-weight: 300;">SEO for small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">:</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Boost Online Visibility</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Enhanced Presence on Google Maps </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Focusing Local Traffic</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Online Rapport Building</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 300;">High Conversion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Budget-Friendly Marketing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Edge on the Competition</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 300;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Mobile-Friendly Usage</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The benefits of </span><span style="font-weight: 300;">local SEO</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">, however, go far beyond Google ranks, you may enjoy improved leads, increased brand awareness, and more. Furthermore, you can&#8217;t afford to lose out on this traffic because localized searches account for nearly half (46%) of all Google searches.</span></p>
<h2><b>Small Business, Big Impacts: Unleash the Potential of Local SEO</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">According to Google, there was a 900% spike in searches for &#8220;near me today/tonight&#8221; between 2017 and 2019. To better serve its users, Google began showing more results for queries with a geographic focus based on closeness, significance, and prominence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Just consider for a while you are searching online for &#8220;best Italian restaurant&#8221; on Google. What will you see? The best Italian restaurants in the United States are rarely found among the top results, and they&#8217;re probably not a part of a large chain. These are typically local restaurants in your city that are run by locals. That is the outcome of local </span><span style="font-weight: 300;">SEO for small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">In other words, you stand a better chance of being searched online by potential clients if your company is close to the search location, provides the services or goods the customer may be looking for, and has optimized local business listings.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">It&#8217;s only the </span><span style="font-weight: 300;">local SEO</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"> that constitutes a small business&#8217;s digital marketing strategy. Its significance stems from its capacity to successfully target and establish a connection with local clients who are actively looking for goods or services in a particular location. Small businesses can boost their exposure, draw in relevant traffic, and eventually improve sales within their local market by optimizing their web presence for local search.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you a business individual looking to attract more local customers? If so, then optimizing your website for local search is crucial. With the proper techniques and strategies, you can give your organization a competitive edge in the online marketplace. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll share essential local SEO tips on optimizing your website for local search and getting more visibility from potential customers in your area.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Overview of Local Search Optimization</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While word-of-mouth is still the finest form of marketing, what happens when potential customers search for your products or services online? To ensure that your website appears in local search results, optimize it for local search.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Optimizing Your Website for Local Search</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, optimizing your website for local search is essential to improve your chances of being found by potential customers in your area. There are several benefits of optimizing your website for local search, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Increased Visibility:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Optimizing your website for local search can help increase your visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs), making prospective customers more likely to find and click on your listing.</span></li>
<li><b>Greater Reach:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Localized keywords can help you reach a wider audience of potential customers within your geographic region.</span></li>
<li><b>More Targeted Traffic:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> By targeting specific keywords and phrases related to your location, you can attract visitors more likely to be interested in your offer.</span></li>
<li><b>Improved ROI:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Optimizing your website for local search can help improve your return on investment (ROI) by generating higher-quality leads more likely to convert into paying customers.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Essential Local SEO Steps to Optimize Your Website for Local Search</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some essential steps you can take to optimize your site for local search:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Add Your Business Listing to Online Directories</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure your business is listed on popular online directories, such as Google My Business, Yelp, and Foursquare. It will help improve your visibility in local search results. </span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><b>Optimize your Website for Local Keywords</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use local keywords in your website content to help enhance your ranking in local search results. For example, if you&#8217;re a Los Angeles plumber, use relevant keywords like &#8220;plumbing Los Angeles&#8221; or &#8220;Los Angeles plumbing services&#8221; throughout your site. </span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><b>Create Local Content</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to using local keywords, create content targeting your local audience. Write blog posts about local news and events, or make videos highlighting your services in specific cities or regions.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b>Promote Your Website Locally</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure your website is promoted locally through offline channels such as print ads, flyers, and word-of-mouth. You can also elevate your site through online channels such as social media and online directories/listings.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Building Links to Your Site</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local search is a powerful way to attract an audience for small businesses. It allows customers to find your business more easily online in local searches and can help you to stand out from the competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most essential things you can do to optimize your website for local search is to build links to your site on local online platforms. It is because links are one of the fundamental factors that search engines use to determine the ranking of websites in their search results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several ways to build links to your website, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submitting your website to local directories and listings sites.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reaching out to local businesses and asking for link exchanges.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participating in local community events and activities.</span></li>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Add photos and videos to showcase your business.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Include relevant keywords in your business description.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Encourage customers to leave reviews on your GMB listing.</span></li>

<h3><b>Local Pack, Finder, Organic Search Results &amp; Google Maps</b></h3>
<p>Local Pack is the specific area that appears on top of the search engine result page but right below the Google Search bar. It contains the listings with pinpoint locations on the map of your desired local business marking the exact location where your business is present.</p>
<p>Local Finder is a location-based feature offered by Google Search which helps you identify your business, whether it appears in the Local Pack of Google or not. Beneath the Local Finder is the Localized Organic Result, which usually appears like every other website in Google Search.</p>
